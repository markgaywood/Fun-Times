Technical Exercise for Java Developer Role. Pricer.java contains main function HenrysGroceries has 4 products each in different units and prices and two discount offers providing reduced prices for a particular time period for particular products. A basket of goods consisting of the number of items bought on a particular day. Four different baskets are given and the program must value each basket correctly, considering how the particular discounts apply. The program calculates the baskets correctly with net prices for the baskets matching the expected price.
It was hoped that I would have junit to test each basket and that it would be posssible to enter new baskets of goods at the command-line. This proved to be the bridge too far as I ran out of time. I have provided the source code here in a number of java files. Basket.java - values basket of goods as a gross price less discounts to give netprice Discounts.java - holds information on each discount offer DiscountTable.java - holds the set of discount offers Items.java - Items for sale in the grocery store Quantities.java - used by Basket class to hold the number of items. Products.java - All the products held by the grocery store Pricer.java - puts the data in the products and discount offer table and values each basket of goods.
